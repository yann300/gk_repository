The Pentagon insists it’s gotten much better though, and has been trumpeting it for “saving lives.” Just don’t ask them to prove it. Several years and $5 billion later, the Army has announced DCGS is going to be withdrawn from a planned testing exercise later this year because of “continued significant software incident reports” and “overall network operational reliability issues.” In layman’s terms, it doesn’t work. In 2011, we reported that the system, then only $2.7 billion worth, was not meeting its goals, crashed all the time, and didn’t work very well when it didn’t crash. Three years, and another $2.3 billion have come and gone, and it is clear that months of Pentagon statements cheering the system were only another example of lies to justify the wasted money on a system that is so buggy they dare not even put it to a serious test, because it just won’t work.

Rechts halte ich einen Burger in der Hand, mit der linken das Lenkrad des geliehenen Opel Astra Kombi. Ich beiße, ich blinke, ich bete - und schaffe es sicher auf die linke Spur. Doch der Unfall scheint unausweichlich. Nicht, dass ich einen Crash auf der Autobahn fürchte. Mehr Angst macht mir eine wacklige Tomate. Gleich flutscht sie vom Burger auf meinem schwarzen Faltenrock. Zwar ist Essen anders als Telefonieren am Steuer vom Gesetzgeber nicht verboten, doch Sven Rademacher, Sprecher des Deutschen Verkehrsicherheitsrats , hält es für fast ebenso gefährlich. \"Ablenkung am Steuer wird unterschätzt\", sagt Rademacher. \"Autofahrer sollten sich bewusst werden über die Gefahren.\" Glaubt man den Umfragen, tun das bisher die wenigsten. Nach einer Erhebung des Allianz Zentrums für Technik (AZT) aus dem Jahr 2011 isst oder trinkt die Hälfte aller Fahrer auch beim Lenken. Ob und wie viele Unfälle dadurch verursacht werden, weist bisher keine Statistik aus. Nur etwas allgemeiner: Nach einer Allianz-Studie wird etwa jeder zehnte Verkehrsunfall durch abgelenkte Autofahrer verursacht. Die Frikadelle folgt der Fliehkraft Aber nimmt die Konzentration durch das Knabbern von Keksen tatsächlich so stark ab, dass es brenzlig wird? Und gilt das für Gummibärchen gleichermaßen wie für Chips oder Schokolade? Wir probieren es auf der Autobahn Richtung Ostsee aus - mit mehrfachem Sicherheitsabstand zum Vorderwagen. Weder uns noch andere wollen wir durch das Experiment gefährden. An einer Raststätte kaufe ich ein: Kekse, Eistee, Nüsse, Schokolade, Gummibärchen, Chips, Wasser und Burger mit Pommes. Nicht besonders gesund, dafür typisches Essen für unterwegs. Alles kommt in eine Tüte, die sicher im Fußraum hinter den Fahrersitz verstaut wird. Nur Burger und Pommes liegen auf meinem Schoß, sie sollen zuerst gegessen werden. Gang rein, rauf auf die Autobahn, das Experiment kann beginnen. Problemlos fingere ich den Burger aus Pappbox und Tüte, beiße zu - lecker ohne Klecker. Doch mit jedem Bissen löst sich der Burger mehr auf. Die Tomate verrutscht, die Frikadelle folgt der Fliehkraft, das Brötchen zerbröselt. Je komplizierter das Essen wird, desto mehr drossele ich das Tempo. Schwimme ich noch mit oder blockiere ich bereits die Bahn? Die Tachonadel zeigt Tempo 95. Ein Faltenrock mit Flecken Nächster Versuch. Stilles Wasser, verpackt in einem Getränkekarton mit Drehverschluss. Mit einer Hand lässt sich das Wasser nicht öffnen, deshalb nehme ich den Verschluss zwischen meine Zähne. Mit einem sanften Knacken dreht der Verschluss lose, doch die Verpackung kann das Wasser nicht halten. Ein Schwall landet auf meinem Schoß. Egal, ob Pommes oder Kekse - fast nichts lässt sich ohne Schweinerei öffnen. Mit Ausnahme einer Packung Nüsse und der Gummibärchen. Zwar habe ich während der Fahrt den Eindruck, alles im Griff zu haben, doch die späteren Filmaufnahmen zeigen, dass mein Blick aufgeregt wandert. Von der Pommes-Tüte auf die Fahrbahn, von der Fahrbahn in den Rückspiegel, vom Rückspiegel auf die Keksverpackung. Dabei sollen doch gerade Frauen in der Lage sein, mehrere Dinge gleichzeitig zu erledigen - ohne, dass eine der Tätigkeiten darunter leidet. Nach einer Studie des Instituts für Arbeit und Gesundheit der Deutschen Gesetzlichen Unfallversicherung (IAG) ist das aber Quatsch. Unabhängig vom Geschlecht wird bei zwei Tätigkeiten eine zugunsten der anderen zur Nebensache. Bei mir war es definitiv das Verspeisen meiner Einkäufe. Die Bilanz des Experiments: ein Faltenrock mit Flecken und die Erkenntnis, dass ich sicher nicht langsamer am Ziel angekommen wäre, wenn ich mir auf dem Rasthof die Zeit für eine Snack-Pause genommen hätte.","title":"Snack-Test im Auto: Nächste Ausfahrt Essen - SPIEGEL ONLINE","host":"www.spiegel.de","customRelevance":1.7000000000000006,"digest":"430571d1d2ff4f93239bc806651ec5b2","boost":"0.05342553","tstamp":"2014-08-21T19:37:22.366Z","url":"http://www.spiegel.de/auto/aktuell/snack-test-selbstversuch-essen-am-steuer-im-opel-astra-kombi-a-980511.html","post_date":"2014/07/21 00:00:00"},"highlight":{"content":["Sn<b>Snack-Test: Selbstve</b>rsuch Essen am Steuer im Opel Astra Kombi Eine Katastrophe bahnt sich an.

Local tribal leaders confirmed 10 civilians slain in the attack, including three children. Hawija was also the site of massive civilian casualties in a military crackdown on protesters in April of 2013, which sparked Sunni unrest that has death tolls soaring ever since. Today’s killings don’t seem particularly strategic on the part of the Iraqi military even if they hadn’t killed nothing but civilians, as Hawija is far outside of their remaining territory and they don’t seem to have any theoretical opportunity to retake it militarily just because it’s within range of aerial assault. The touchstone that Hawija was for the Sunni uprising against the Maliki government also makes it a particularly poor choice of target, and it wasn’t clear why Iraq chose to try it, of the many, many cities ISIS now controls.

Donetsk is the largest city in the rebel-held east of the country, and has been regularly targeted by the Ukrainian military, which has been ordered to cleanse the region of “ parasites .” President Petro Poroshenko has ordered the military to continue its offensive, but has ordered them not to attack the rebels near the MH17 plane crash site, apparently hoping to keep the pretense of violent rebels against a peaceful government alive, at least in the immediate vicinity of the international press.

Media requires JavaScript to play. Adam Brimelow explains how the patch works. Continue reading the main story Related Stories NHS gets safe nurse staffing rules How many nurses short is the NHS? The NHS is starting to test a sticking-plaster-sized patient-monitoring patch. Placed on the chest, it wirelessly transmits data on heart rate, breathing and body-temperature while the patient is free to move around. Independent experts say the system, developed in Britain, could ease pressure on wards and has the potential to monitor patients in their own home. But the Royal College of Nursing says there is no substitute for having enough staff. Routine checks for vital signs - including temperature, blood pressure and heart rate - are a key part of care and safety in hospitals. Typically they may be carried out every four hours, depending on the patient's condition. But patients can deteriorate between checks, putting them at risk. Continue reading the main story “ Start Quote It gives us a bit more time with some patients when we know some patients do need that bit more time. ” End Quote Victoria Howard Nurse A hospital in Brighton run by the private healthcare firm Spire has been testing the battery-powered patch, which updates information on some of the vital signs every couple of minutes. The wireless device, developed by the Oxford-based firm Sensium Healthcare, then issues an alert if the readings fall outside pre-set levels, indicating a potential problem. The patch is placed on the chest just above the heart when the patient is admitted. There are no cables to any monitors. Instead, readings are recorded and transmitted to a box in each room that works like a wi-fi router, passing on data to the hospital IT system. 'Eases pressures' It does not replace the routine checks, but staff say it does ease some of the pressures. Victoria Howard, a staff nurse at the hospital said the system was working well. \"It gives us a bit more time with some patients when we know some patients do need that bit more time,\" she said. \"Without this monitor, you're constantly thinking what's happening in the next room, and I should go in there and check them. \"Knowing this is on and it works well, we're able to spend that bit more time.\" Most of the patients at this hospital are in for routine surgery. Some are being treated for cancer. The matron, Lynette Awdrey, said the patches helped staff focus their efforts on the patients who needed the most support. \"It prioritises you,\" she said. \"Nothing will ever replace compete with clinical observation and the assessment of the patients. What this does is alert you sooner, so you can fulfil those observations and assessments of the patient and activate the appropriate care and treatment for them.\" So far, she said, the patches had provided early detection of deterioration in about 12% of patients who had worn them. That is in line with findings from a small trial with the patches at a hospital in Los Angeles. Safety implications This could have important safety implications. A study in the British Medical Journal in 2012 concluded that nearly 12,000 deaths in hospitals in England had been preventable. It said clinical monitoring had been a problem in nearly a third of these deaths. Another advantage of the device is that patients can move around freely. This reduces the risk of complications such as infections, helping patients to recover more quickly, so they can go home sooner, saving on the costs of healthcare. David Hardman, 71, is happy to wear the patch. \"It gives me reassurance that there's something, or some equipment looking at it all the time,\" he said. \"And I think when the nurse is with you her mind is perhaps a bit more with you rather than thinking about what's going on in the other rooms.\" Each patch costs £35 and lasts for five days - long enough for most hospital stays. Wear at home Independent experts say we are witnessing the start of a revolution in wearable technology, with great potential benefits in healthcare. Prof Timothy Coats, a consultant in emergency medicine at Leicester Royal Infirmary, said the patch could be useful in a variety of different settings. \"This certainly could have a use in the emergency department from the emergency care phase right through to the first couple of days in hospital when the patient is more liable to deteriorate. \"It also has potentially an application for looking after patients in their own home, because we could observe them remotely rather than in hospital.\" However he points out there are limitations with the current model, which measures heart rate, breathing and body temperature. It is being developed to provide more information, on blood pressure and oxygen levels. The company says the patch is about to be tested at one NHS trust and 20 more are in talks. The Royal College of Nursing's chief executive, Dr Peter Carter, said new technology could be very helpful in alerting nurses and doctors to a patient who was starting to deteriorate - but he also expressed a note of caution. \"Anything which helps that process has to be a good thing,\" he said. \"However, we also know that there is no substitute for having enough staff with the right level of skill on every ward, able to give each and every patient the care and attention that critically ill people need.\"","title":"NHS tests 'plaster' patient-monitor","host":"www.bbc.com","customRelevance":1,"digest":"1607765aeb9f95d6436fe4eb1c84cae3","boost":"0.10183302","tstamp":"2014-08-21T19:37:31.106Z","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-28317509","post_date":"2014/07/22 00:00:00"},"highlight":{"content":["he NHS is starting to t<b>starting to test a s</b><b>o test a sticki</b>ng-plaster-sized patient-monitoring patch.

Litvinenko widow wins inquiry ruling ‘Russia role' in spy death suggested An inquiry will be held into the death of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko, the Home Secretary Theresa May has announced. Mr Litvinenko, a former KGB officer, died in 2006 in a London hospital after he was allegedly poisoned with radioactive polonium. The investigation will examine whether the Russian state was behind his death. Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina, said she was \"relieved and delighted\", saying the \"truth will win out in the end\". Announcing the inquiry - which will be chaired by Sir Robert Owen, a senior judge and the coroner overseeing Mr Litvinenko's inquest - Theresa May said she hoped it would be of \"some comfort\" to Mrs Litvinenko. The former Russian spy, 43, died after he was poisoned with radioactive polonium while drinking tea with two Russian men, one a former KGB officer, at a London hotel. His family believe he was working for MI6 at the time of his death and was killed on the orders of the Kremlin. 'Appalling crime' In a statement, Mrs Litvinenko said: \"No matter how strong and powerful you are, truth will win out in the end and you will be held accountable for your crimes. \"I look forward to the day when the truth behind my husband's murder is revealed for the whole world to see,\" she added. A government spokesman said his death was \"an appalling crime and we want to see those responsible prosecuted through the courts\".

His death is attributed to radiation poisoning May 2007 - The UK decides Mr Lugovoi should be charged with the murder of Mr Litvinenko.

The announcement comes after the government had previously resisted calls for a public inquiry, saying it would first \"wait and see\" what a judge-led inquest found. However, in 2013 a coroner ruled that a public inquiry - which could have wider powers than an inquest - would be better placed to establish how Mr Litvinenko died. Ministers still refused to launch an inquiry, which prompted a legal challenge by Mr Litvinenko's widow, Marina. She said only a public inquiry would uncover the Russian state's alleged role in her husband's 2006 death from radiation poisoning. In February, the High Court said the Home Office had been wrong to rule out an inquiry before the outcome of an inquest. Analysis from BBC political editor Nick Robinson Whitehall sources say that the timing of an announcement of a public inquiry into whether the Russian state was responsible for the murder of the dissident Andrei Litvinenko is pure coincidence. The police and security services concluded a long time ago that this was a state-sponsored murder. The former Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Lord MacDonald has said as much in public. However, the home secretary has been resisting calls for an inquiry from the Litvinenko family and the inquest judge, citing \"international relations\". Those reasons seem to no longer be quite so pressing. Read more from Nick Sir Richard Ottaway, chairman of the foreign affairs select committee, said the timing of the announcement was \"a bit quirky\" given the international situation following the Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crash in Ukraine. But the Conservative MP said launching an inquiry was \"absolutely the right thing to do\". BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said sources had been playing down suggestions the timing of the announcement was linked to current tensions with Moscow. However, he said the timing can \"only further test the already strained relations\" between London and Moscow.","title":"Litvinenko death inquiry announced","host":"www.bbc.com","customRelevance":1,"digest":"46790930a3d39758abeb1bb219be7e98","boost":"0.11913612","tstamp":"2014-08-21T19:37:38.036Z","url":"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-28416532","post_date":"2014/07/22 00:00:00"},"highlight":{"content":["ensions with Moscow.

Rosenbaum, before the ultrasound. (Todd Wawrychuk/ABC) Every year on “The Bachelorette,” the “Men Tell All” episode — the one that airs the week before the finale — is always the wackiest. All of the eliminated contestants gather in front of a studio audience to hash out the drama that happened during the season, and the “Bachelorette” is forced to show up and answer questions. There are always fights and sometimes tears. It’s tradition. This year, there was all of that, plus lots of the usual ingredients that make “Men Tell All” a special brand of reality TV. Host Chris Harrison barely contained his delight as several men had to re-watch footage of “Bachelorette” Andi breaking up with them; a random audience member made things awkward as she confessed she had a crush on one of the contestants; and Harrison read some scandalous results of lie detector tests from earlier in the season. But things took a couple odd turns — on, honestly, what is already a really unsettling season  – when producers featured a former “Bachelorette” couple undergo a live ultrasound to find out the sex of their unborn child. Then, there was a rather heated fight about alleged racist comments by a contestant earlier in the season. First, the ultrasound: Team Bachelor likes to parade out its successful couples (four out of 28 seasons so far) to prove that the show really can help find love. So Ashley and J.P. dutifully appeared to be adorable and chat about their baby and upcoming move to Miami. Then a surprise: Greg the Ultrasound Technician — not a regular character on the show — showed up to help the couple find out if Ashley was expecting a boy or a girl. “Let’s do this!” Harrison cheered, explaining that this medical procedure was a first for the “Bachelorette” franchise. “We’re going to find out the sex of this baby.” Dramatic music played. Ashley and J.P. stared at the screen. Harrison cracked bad jokes. Greg the Ultrasound Technician took his sweet time. The studio audience waited in breathless anticipation. (The viewing audience, not so much, if you follow Ashley on Twitter; she revealed the news weeks ago.) To everyone else, it was very tense — we half expected Harrison to pull a Ryan Seacrest and promise the results after the break. But no, Greg finally told them the good news: It’s a boy! J.P.’s eyes welled up with tears at the thought of his son, and millions of viewers felt wildly uncomfortable as they intruded on a very private family moment. Later, things got serious. “I want to go to the most sensitive issue of the entire season,” Harrison said sternly. That would be back in Episode 5: One contestant, J.J., claimed that another, Andrew, allegedly made a racist comment after Andi gave roses during the first rose ceremony to Ron and Marquel, the two black men on the show. Andrew adamantly denied from the beginning that he ever made such a statement. Chris Harrison talking to Marquel. (Todd Wawrychuk/ABC) Harrison wanted to make sure to get everything out in the open. Marquel said he was caught off guard when J.J. told him what Andrew said, and it has yet to be resolved. Andrew jumped in to defend himself, but immediately got off to a bad start when he accidentally referred to Marquel as “Ron” as soon as he started talking. Cue the camera panning to a shocked audience member, mouth wide open. Andrew started trying to defend himself, saying J.J. had an “agenda,” until Harrison cut in to get back to the matter at hand. “We do have it on camera,” Harrison said. “Have what?” Andrew asked, looking startled. “The moment in question,” Harrison said. “I’ll show you what we have.” “I’m not worried about it,” Andrew replied, still looking confused. Producers showed archive footage in question: After Andi gave Ron the rose in the premiere, you could see that Andrew briefly leaned over and whispered something to J.J. Only no one could hear what he actually said, so it was completely pointless. “That leaves a lot open to interpretation,” Andrew pointed out, the understatement of the night. “I’ll be honest,” Harrison admitted. “We don’t have the audio.” Some other contestants jumped in to confirm that there was muttering at that moment — they have no idea what he said, but there were definitely noises that sounded like Andrew saying words. Okay then. Harrison demands Andrew explain what he really said. “I believe I said something to the effect of, ‘It’s been a long night,’ and ‘When is this going to be over with?’” Andrew recalled. “That was not what was said,” snapped J.J., the one who told Marquel about Andrew’s alleged words in the first place. The two started bickering and Harrison turned to J.J.: “This is an incredibly sensitive and controversial claim to make against somebody — so just to be clear, do you still stand behind it?” J.J. confirmed he 100 percent stood behind it. He and Andrew started fighting yet again as Andrew claimed the allegations have already hurt his personal life. All the men started arguing about who said what and when, and finally Harrison brought it back to Marquel. “Do I have proof that you said it? Absolutely not,” Marquel said to Andrew. “I’m not attacking you, Andrew…but at the same time, I will never forgive the ignorance that is racism.” “I’m on board with you,” Andrew agreed with the sentiment, as the audience also applauded. Marquel went on for awhile about Andrew just seemed being worried about potentially losing his job over the matter, and never acknowledged that Marquel felt offended by the whole incident, no matter what happened. Ron chimed in and called Andrew ignorant, while Andrew again denied saying anything offensive — Harrison decided to solve the matter by asking Marquel to speculate on what he think really happened. Marquel went on for awhile, but essentially boiled down to: He believes his friend J.J. was telling the truth about what Andrew said. Realizing this wasn’t going to end until he said he was sorry, Andrew apologized. Again, he said, he could understand why Marquel was offended, and reminds him again that these allegations are affecting his life — and hopes he and Marquel can be friends after all of this.

High altitude and vast expanses of outfield grass ensure even the most motley outfit will stumble into one ripe opportunity, one chance to send a game-altering hit hurtling through the thin Rocky Mountain air. Monday night, the teams with the best and worst records in the National League met on Blake Street. Before the Washington Nationals finished their 7-2 victory , the Colorado Rockies summoned a chance to topple them. Doug Fister had resisted, but the ballpark finally chewed him up with one out to go in the sixth inning. Manager Matt Williams trudged to the mound with the bases loaded, asked for the ball and gave it to Aaron Barrett. \"You're never out of a game here,\" Williams said. \"And you're never comfortable here.\" Barrett struck out Brandon Barnes with a slider from hell, which remained the night's key moment even after the Nationals added three insurance runs. The Nationals catapulted into first place and ran their NL-best record to 54-43, 11 games over .500 for the first time this season. Ian Desmond became the third player in Nationals history to go 5 for 5, including a two-run homer off Rockies left-handed starter Franklin Morales that sparked a four-run fourth inning. Even he conceded the most important moment happened when Barrett relieved Fister. \"That was, in my eyes, the turning point of the game,\" Desmond said. \"He did a great job.\" Pivotal outs in a five-run victory, like the one the Nationals used Monday to surpass the Atlanta Braves, rarely happen in the sixth inning. Coors Field is different. It is an exhausting place to win even if the home team stinks. It finds ways to test teams, managers and pitching staffs even when the game seems squarely in their hands. The test Monday night meant Barrett jogging in from the bullpen with the game hanging in the balance. Fister teetered in the sixth after five scoreless innings. He exited after he walked DJ LeMahieu, the No. 8 hitter, to load the bases with the Nationals clinging to a 4-2 lead. It didn't matter that the Rockies had lost five in a row or 44 of their last 62. They had a chance.    \"Anything's possible,\" Desmond said. Somehow, none of Fister's 139 career starts had come at Coors Field. The ball travels further here, of course, but it also behaves differently when it leaves a pitcher's hand. Curveballs tend to hang. Two-seam fastballs, like the one Fister relies on, sink less. Livan Hernandez always hated Coors Field because it neutralized his guile. Fister figured it out, changing speeds and keeping fly balls in the park, before the Rockies scored two as they pounded five hits off him. \"There's definitely adjustments that needed to be made,\" Fister said. \"Whether it's your curveball or your sinker, there's a little less movement. You've got to focus on location and let that override the movement.\" As the Rockies rallied in the sixth, Fister suffered a minor twisted ankle trying to knock down a single up the middle from Carlos Gonzalez.  \"I kind of tweaked it a little, but I'll be fine,\" Fister said. \"It's one of those things that will be sore for a day or so, and it'll be right back to normal.\" Fister yielded to Barrett, who faced Barnes, a hulking pinch hitter. Barrett, a rookie, had never pitched at altitude before. In the bullpen, his slider spun but wouldn't break. He told himself to stay with the pitch longer and focus on his follow through. \"I've been put in that spot a couple times this year,\" Barrett said. \"But I think for me, it's about getting strike one, just attacking right out of the gate. Just try to keep a simple mind-set and go right after him.\"  In tight spots, Barrett relies on that slider, the pitch that brought him to the majors back in spring training. It required him to place his trust in catcher Wilson Ramos. He wanted to bury it in the dirt, but if it scooted by Ramos, it would cost him a run. In the first four pitches Barrett fired at Barnes, three were sliders, the last of which Barnes took in the dirt for a ball. Barrett went back to the same pitch, and this time Barnes flailed. Ramos blocked the pitch and stepped on home plate. \"It's a difference,\" Barrett said. \"You can get timid on a certain pitch. You want to make a perfect pitch instead of having full confidence and just, 'Okay, I'm going to throw it in the dirt, and he's going to block it. No big deal.' \" The Nationals gave the rest of their bullpen a cushion. Ryan Zimmerman led off with a walk and Desmond pushed him to second with a single. When Ramos drilled a single to right, third base coach Bobby Henley windmilled Zimmerman home, which may or may not be the only action his right arm is capable of. Zimmerman tumbled to the dish as catcher Wilin Rosario muffed the tag. \"It felt like I fell off a motorcycle,\" Zimmerman said. One batter later, Desmond scampered home to make it 6-2. In the ninth, Danny Espinosa mashed an RBI triple while batting from the left side to give the Nationals one added layer of protection. The Nationals erupted in the fourth inning. Zimmerman led off and smoked a single to left field. Desmond fell behind, 1-2, and Morales tried to finish him off with a curveball, which against Desmond seemed like safe strategy. Last year, 13 of Desmond's 20 home runs came on offspeed pitches, but this season he hadn't belted a single curveball over the fence. Morales's curve hung, though, and Desmond crushed it. The ball zoomed on a line over the left field fence. Desmond's 17 th homer pushed the Nationals ahead, 2-0. \"I don't look for anything,\" Desmond said. \"I just look for the ball and swing as hard as I can.\" The barrage had just started. Wilson Ramos singled up the middle, then rambled all the home when Espinosa blasted a double off the base of the center field fence. Williams inserted Espinosa at second base for his defense behind Fister, who induces gobs of groundballs. Espinosa rewarded him with the RBI double, his first hit since June 22, a span of 27 at-bats. \"It was satisfying,\" Espinosa said. \"It's fun to be part of the win when you make an impact.\"   Fister followed Espinosa and tried to give the Rockies an out, pushing a bunt toward third base. Morales scooped the ball and looked toward third, but Espinosa's speed negated a play there. Morales whirled and fired a low throw to first that pulled Ben Paulsen off the bag. The Nationals still had no outs, and runners stood on first and third. For reasons unknown to anyone in Coors Field, Morales tried to pick off Fister. The ball sailed off Paulsen's head and bounded down the right field fence. Espinosa trotted home, and Fister loped to third, now in possession of a 4-0 lead.   It seemed like the Nationals would have an easy win, but those do not exist at Coors Field. The Nationals had to scrap, at least for a moment, and they did. Nationals note: Kevin Frandsen turned his ankle during a pinch-hit at-bat in the ninth inning and hobbled to first base. Williams expected him to be sore, but did not think he suffered a significant injury. \"It's a rolled ankle,\" Williams said. \"We'll see how he is to treatment and see how he is tomorrow.\" More on the Nationals : Box score: Nationals 7, Rockies 2 Williams sits red-hot Harper For Soriano, a breath of fresh air Zimmerman finding his power?

But lately, it hasn't been difficult at all. \"The calls and requests just don't stop,\" said one European diplomat in the US capital. The shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH 17 over eastern Ukraine, presumably by pro-Russian separatists, is considered to be a game changer in Washington -- an event of such magnitude that the status quo is no longer possible. All 298 passengers on board the Boeing 777 perished in the crash. Washington officials have been clear with the Europeans about the lessons it has learned from the disaster, namely that EU members needs to adopt a tougher stance in its dealings with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Even prior to the Flight MH 17 disaster, pressure for additional sanctions in Washington had been growing. Bloomberg reported that Deputy National Security Advisor Anthony Blinken held a closed-door meeting a week ago with EU ambassadors to inform them of the actions Washington would like to see Europe take. Photo Gallery 13  Photos Photo Gallery: The Contested Crash Site of MH17 The Americans are proposing an end to EU weapons deliveries to Russia. With orders on the books for two Mistral-class amphibious assault ships for Russia worth 1.2 billion ($1.6 billion), that move could hit France particularly hard. The White House also says it would like to see further restrictions placed on Russia's access to money and capital markets. Washington Doesn't Want Further Excuses The US government's message is clear: Impatience is growing over the constant excuse given by the Europeans that they can't afford to isolate Russia for economic and energy policy reasons. Public statements given by President Barack Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry are getting brisker, with both speaking in unison of a \"wakeup call for Europe.\" On Sunday, Kerry told ABC News there was \"powerful\" evidence suggesting that the Russians had provided both training and weapons to the rebels. In US government circles, many believe the Europeans will go along with sanctions this time. \"This tragedy is so enormous, and above all so palpable for European countries like the Netherlands, that the Europeans will finally have to move decisively against Putin,\" says Jack Janes of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies in Washington. Some 189 of the passengers who perished on board Flight MH 17 were Dutch citizens. Will the Europeans be swayed this time? Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt and his Polish colleague Radoslaw Sikorski have both called for tougher sanctions against Moscow. And British Defense Minister Michael Fallon has accused Russia of \"sponsored terrorism\". Although they threatened there would be \"consequences\" for Moscow over the weekend, EU members Italy, Germany and France have remained hesitant about applying further sanctions. Many EU leaders believe that sufficient action was taken at a summit last week in which they expanded current sanctions that are largely focused on banning travel and blocking the foreign bank accounts of oligarch billionaires who support Russian decision-makers. Hesitance in Europe It remains uncertain whether EU foreign ministers meeting in Brussels on Tuesday will go beyond a general discussion of the shooting down of the Malaysia Airlines flight to actually agree on further punitive measures. The French government is also opposed to British calls to penalize the entire Russian defense sector. Cameron is now considering an alternative embargo applying only to new weapons deals with Russia, which would exclude the French Mistral sale. That deal was approved by former French President Nicolas Sarkozy in 2011. His successor, François Hollande, said earlier this week that the first helicopter carrier is nearly complete and would be delivered as planned in October. However, he said delivery of a second ship would depend on Russia's attitude in the Ukraine crisis. Obama's government is expected to wait until after the EU foreign ministers meet on Tuesday, but administration officials are already preparing the next steps, with measures aimed at Russia's financial sector. Officials are also considering an export ban on dual-use technologies that can be used for both civil or military applications. Heather Conley, a Europe expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, believes trans-Atlantic relations could be put to the test again if the United States and Europe don't pull together. \"The Americans know that sanctions again Russia will only work if the Europeans take part,\" she says. \"After all, the EU has far greater trade with Russia than the Americans do.\" Trans-Atlantic policy expert Janes says that expectations are accordingly high. \"People here are following very closely just how prepared EU member states are for sanctions -- especially Germany, which is so strong economically,\" he says.","title":"US Loses Patience with Europe: Washington Wants Tough Russia Sanctions - SPIEGEL ONLINE","host":"www.spiegel.de","customRelevance":1,"digest":"d90f15096d3ed2e4ac602c232c6bd426","boost":"0.053416796","tstamp":"2014-08-21T19:37:06.082Z","url":"http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/washington-pressures-european-union-to-apply-deeper-russia-sanctions-a-982271.html","post_date":"2014/07/22 00:00:00"},"highlight":{"content":["3  Photos Photo Gallery: The Contested Crash Site<b>teste</b> of MH17 The Americans are proposing an end to EU w","ut to the t<b> put to the test a</b><b> the test again if</b><b>the test again if</b><b>test again if the</b> United States and Europe don't pull together. \"The Americans know t"]},"sort":[0.052973405,1405987200000]},{"_index":"index","_type":"doc","_id":"com.jeuneafrique.www:http/Article/ARTJAWEB20140721110828/","_score":0.051044844, "_source" : {"id":"com.jeuneafrique.www:http/Article/ARTJAWEB20140721110828/","content":"AlgÃ©rie : les Fennecs envoient 100 000 dollars \"aux enfants de Gaza\" Avec ce don, les Fennecs expriment leur \"solidaritÃ©\" aux habitants de Gaza. © AFP Selon un communiqué officiel publié dimanche, les Fennecs ont décidé d'octroyer un don de 10 millions de dinars, soit 100 000 dollars, aux enfants de Gaza.

J.P.’s eyes welled up with tears at the thought of his son, and millions of viewers felt wildly uncomfortable as they intruded on a very private family moment. Later, things got serious. “I want to go to the most sensitive issue of the entire season,” Harrison said sternly. That would be back in Episode 5: One contestant, J.J., claimed that another, Andrew, allegedly made a racist comment after Andi gave roses during the first rose ceremony to Ron and Marquel, the two black men on the show. Andrew adamantly denied from the beginning that he ever made such a statement. Chris Harrison talking to Marquel. (Todd Wawrychuk/ABC) Harrison wanted to make sure to get everything out in the open. Marquel said he was caught off guard when J.J. told him what Andrew said, and it has yet to be resolved. Andrew jumped in to defend himself, but immediately got off to a bad start when he accidentally referred to Marquel as “Ron” as soon as he started talking. Cue the camera panning to a shocked audience member, mouth wide open. Andrew started trying to defend himself, saying J.J. had an “agenda,” until Harrison cut in to get back to the matter at hand. “We do have it on camera,” Harrison said. “Have what?” Andrew asked, looking startled. “The moment in question,” Harrison said. “I’ll show you what we have.” “I’m not worried about it,” Andrew replied, still looking confused. Producers showed archive footage in question: After Andi gave Ron the rose in the premiere, you could see that Andrew briefly leaned over and whispered something to J.J. Only no one could hear what he actually said, so it was completely pointless. “That leaves a lot open to interpretation,” Andrew pointed out, the understatement of the night. “I’ll be honest,” Harrison admitted. “We don’t have the audio.” Some other contestants jumped in to confirm that there was muttering at that moment — they have no idea what he said, but there were definitely noises that sounded like Andrew saying words. Okay then. Harrison demands Andrew explain what he really said. “I believe I said something to the effect of, ‘It’s been a long night,’ and ‘When is this going to be over with?’” Andrew recalled. “That was not what was said,” snapped J.J., the one who told Marquel about Andrew’s alleged words in the first place. The two started bickering and Harrison turned to J.J.: “This is an incredibly sensitive and controversial claim to make against somebody — so just to be clear, do you still stand behind it?” J.J. confirmed he 100 percent stood behind it. He and Andrew started fighting yet again as Andrew claimed the allegations have already hurt his personal life. All the men started arguing about who said what and when, and finally Harrison brought it back to Marquel. “Do I have proof that you said it? Absolutely not,” Marquel said to Andrew. “I’m not attacking you, Andrew…but at the same time, I will never forgive the ignorance that is racism.” “I’m on board with you,” Andrew agreed with the sentiment, as the audience also applauded. Marquel went on for awhile about Andrew just seemed being worried about potentially losing his job over the matter, and never acknowledged that Marquel felt offended by the whole incident, no matter what happened. Ron chimed in and called Andrew ignorant, while Andrew again denied saying anything offensive — Harrison decided to solve the matter by asking Marquel to speculate on what he think really happened. Marquel went on for awhile, but essentially boiled down to: He believes his friend J.J. was telling the truth about what Andrew said. Realizing this wasn’t going to end until he said he was sorry, Andrew apologized. Again, he said, he could understand why Marquel was offended, and reminds him again that these allegations are affecting his life — and hopes he and Marquel can be friends after all of this.

Some of these experiences with Metro’s week of “simulated service” on the Silver Line may help in planning your commutes for this afternoon and the rest of the week. Many trains on both the Blue and Orange lines were packed by the time they approached the District. But I didn’t see anything on the trains or platforms that a regular rider would have found alarming, despite the decline in the number of Blue Line trains and the number of Orange Line trains at the far western stations. Why not? We’re deep into summer vacation season, so many people who would be on those trains are away. Also, Mondays tend to have fewer commuters than midweek days. Blue Line riders went through their first cutback two years ago, and may already be familiar with the coping strategies. Most Orange Line stations have the same level of rush hour service they had before the Silver Line testing began. A Largo-bound Orange Line train reaches Rosslyn. This is one of the Silver Line test trains. (Robert Thomson/The Washington Post) Train conditions. My six-car Blue Line train from Franconia-Springfield got crowded at Pentagon City, but riders at Pentagon could still board without difficulty. My six-car Blue Line train from Rosslyn to Metro Center was difficult to board. The big exodus was at Farragut West. Plenty of seats were available after that. That tells me most people aboard my Blue Line train were there because it made sense for them, given their destination. (Taking the Yellow Line to L’Enfant Plaza and transferring isn’t a good alternative for them.) At Rosslyn. I figured the junction of the Blue and Orange lines was a good observation point to compare train crowding. Between 8 and 9 a.m., most trains on both lines were very crowded. There was less crowding on the Silver Line test trains, the ones that this week become Orange Line trains at East Falls Church and carry passengers between there and Largo Town Center. But another more common factor that almost always made a difference was the spacing between trains. If there was a gap of just a few minutes, the next arriving train would be especially crowded. If the two following trains arrived quickly after that, then the second of those trains was positively roomy by comparison to the earlier ones. Eight cars are better. An eight-car train always had breathing room compared to a six-car train, especially in the last two cars. Half of the Blue Line trains operating during peak periods are now eight cars long, Metro says. That’s swell if the next-arriving train is a long one, but if not, would you really wait at least 12 more minutes for the extra space or would you try to squeeze aboard a six-car train? Going home. The afternoon rush from the Blue/Orange downtown platforms to the suburbs is a bit different this week. Riders will see a greater proportion of trains marked as Orange Line to East Falls Church or Largo. A smaller portion of the Orange Line trains will have Vienna or New Carrollton as their destinations. If your home destination is, say, Landover, there’s really no choice but to wait it out for a New Carrollton train. If your going back to West Falls Church, or Dunn Loring or Vienna, but those Vienna-bound trains are looking really packed, you might get a less crowded ride this week on a train marked “East Falls Ch.” You would have to get off along with everybody else on the train at East Falls Church and wait for the next Vienna-bound train, but it’s likely to be less crowded than it was at the downtown stations.","title":"Metro riders experience simulated Silver Line","host":"www.washingtonpost.com","customRelevance":1,"digest":"4866536b896afdf8091817cdeb8e5c12","boost":"0.05924876","tstamp":"2014-08-21T19:38:35.054Z","url":"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/dr-gridlock/wp/2014/07/21/metro-riders-experience-simulated-silver-line/","post_date":"2014/07/21 00:00:00"},"highlight":{"content":["ations have the same level of rush hour service they had before the Silver Line t<b>lver Line testi</b><b>e testi</b><b>testi</b>ng began.

Le même texte a également annoncé l'arrivée de Christian Gourcuff à la tête de la sélection algérienne. Dans certaines circonstances, seul le geste compte, dit-on. Après le quiproquo autour de la promesse de donner l'intégralité de leurs primes du Mondial au peuple palestinien, les joueurs de l'équipe nationale algérienne ont finalement \"décidé d'octroyer un don de 10 millions de dinars (100 000 dollars) aux enfants de Gaza\". L'annonce a été faite le 20 juillet au lendemain d'une réunion statutaire de la Fédération algérienne de football (FAF) qui a expliqué qu'il s'agissait pour les joueurs d'exprimer leur \"solidarité\" aux habitants de Gaza, confrontés aux bombardements de l'armée israélienne depuis trois semaines . Gourcuff succède de Halilhodzic Par ailleurs, la FAF a également annoncé \"la nomination de Christian Gourcuff en qualité de sélectionneur national pour les équipes A et A' à partir du 1er août\". Le technicien français \"participera également au programme de formation et de développement de la Direction technique nationale\". Très prochainement, un \"contrat d'objectifs\" sera remis au remplaçant de Vahid Halilhodzic .
